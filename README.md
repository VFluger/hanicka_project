# 🎁 Hanicka Project

A personal, private birthday gift for my love — Hanča ❤️  
Built with care, for smiles, cuddles, and compliments.

## 🌸 What’s Inside

This is a **closed development** project in a public repo (read-only). It won’t accept contributions — just something for us two.

It's like a online platform for daily usage and personalized with inside jokes and cute stuff.
